Nibble
======

This project was created over the course of a weekend at LA Startup Weekend 2013. Nibble is a working Objective-C prototype demonstrating an app allowing users to book reservations at restaurants. Through user research, we found that restaurants had a huge problem with reservations that become 'no-shows', losing other customers. Because of this, some restaurants have abandoned a reservation system altogether. This app would charge the customer for failing to show up at restaurants, essentially having a collateral against customers not showing up.
